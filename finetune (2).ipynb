At 6'2\\\", the taller suspect matched the description of James Morton, a known criminal in the area. He has a prior record for theft, which made him a person of interest immediately. The fact that the crowbar used to break the display cases had fibers that matched Morton\\u2019s vehicle made the connection even stronger. After obtaining a search warrant, we found the same black boots with white soles seen on the CCTV footage in his apartment the next day. We also found a crowbar in the trunk of his car with traces of glass consistent with the broken display cases. Morton denied any involvement, but based on the evidence, I have no doubt he was involved.\",\n          \"James Morton is a good friend of mine.

I had his phone with me because I needed it to call the mechanic if there were any issues. That\\u2019s why his phone pinged in the area. James wasn\\u2019t anywhere near Luxe Jewelers that night.
